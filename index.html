                <h3>Listening To Old Playlists</h3>

                    I would like to imagine that a lot of people tend to think back on old times and remember the music they used to listen to at the time. I must confess that I do this quite often when I grow tired of listening to new tracks all the time, so I pop open the metaphotical CD rack and click one into my Walkman.

                    That feeling when you press the play button on a song that you haven't heard for a decade is surreal, to say the least. All of the sudden your head rushes with memories, feelings, thoughts from when you listened to that song so long ago. It's the closest we can get to time travel without inventing a time machine. Hearing a song again after ages is akin to hearing it for the first time again. This wave of nostalgia seems to work best on music that I haven't listened to since some time beyond the scope of my memory. This wave of nostalgia can, however, bring with it a nasty thing. People who get clouded by nostalgia can sometimes get lost in it and end up denouncing all other music. A common phrase used is "they don't make music like they used to." In other words, these are people who have very strong opinions on older music. Old music is sometimes regarded as perfect in every possible way, which is certainly one opinion to have.

                    The issue with comparing songs of the past to recent hits is that you don't have that same feeling of nostalgia that inflates your enjoyment of a song that came out within the past year. I hate to make this argument because I feel like one of those kinds of people that are always saying "oh, they don't make music like they used to." They do, but music changes significantly over time. New sounds and new genres bask in the limelight, and older songs are left in the wake of musical innovation. There will likely be a point in the future when somebody will pop open their music list and play Billie Eilish for "old times' sake."

                    On the same topic, there is an interesting phenomenon that accelerates the process of aging music: death. This is a bit of a grave observation to make, but I find it to be true nonetheless. There are many examples, but one of the most popular instances of this is with Michael Jackson. There was a resurgence in media when he passed away. A few other notable examples are artists Juice WRLD and XXXTentacion. Both were rising in popularity due to their music, but in death, they became legends in their field. I would daresay that they were put on pedestals up there with Tupac.

                    Generally, talk about music is nice when it is about your light opinion on a track or remembering an old banger from a long time ago. When you become an critic because you listen to one artist for a year straight, the conversation turns a bit sour. If I wanted a professional opinion on music, I would go read the opinion of someone who gets paid to make those opinions.

                    Computer technology has seen leaps in innovation that would have been unimaginable in the past, but now appears to be commonplace. Generational leaps in technology have been steady since computers and their parts began mass production. Since 1980 with the release of Pac-Man, video games have seen steady improvement in all aspects. My main focus, however, is in the decade of 2010-2020.

                    2010 saw the release of video games such as Red Dead Redemption, Halo: Reach, Call of Duty: Black Ops, and more. Red Dead Redemption and Halo: Reach in particular are impressive in their own ways. They made use of as much power in the Xbox 360 console as possible. These games' graphics were impressive in comparison to other games of their time. They were able to run with beautiful graphics at 720p, 30 frames per second performance. These games pushed the limit, and franchises' fans noticed. These games were among the best in each of their respective series.
                </p>

                    Fast forward to 2015, where the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 are past their honeymoon periods have ended, and developers are accustomed to the potential of the consoles. This year contains the release of video games such as The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Fallout 4, Halo 5: Guardians, and Bloodborne among others. The Witcher 3 takes the open world formula that was used before by games such as Red Dead Redemption, and does it better in every way. The map size is much bigger, the graphics are much better, the resolution is higher, and there is more power and performance than ever before (this is a recurring theme between generations).

                    On the PC side, Nvidia has been hard at work to release ever better graphics cards to support ever better graphics. The GeForce GTX 980-TI was released in 2015, and its performance is staggering in comparison to a graphics card from 2010. Compared to a GeForce GTX 580, which released in 2010, the 980-TI is over 200% better in almost every category (information courtesy of <a href="https://www.userbenchmark.com">userbenchmark.com</a>). This allows for massive improvements in performance and graphics quality. PCs were able to push games even further than consoles could, with 1080p, 60 frames per second being the target performance.

                    One more time leap later, and its 2020. The Xbox Series X/S is slated for release, as well as the PlayStation 5. Video games such as DOOM Eternal, Cyberpunk 2077, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Ghost of Tsushima among others are released or soon to be released. The graphics alone on these games are awe-inspiring, to say the least. I will say the line that many others have said before about a game, "this is the closest to real life we can get." The sheer graphical quality of these games are nearly photorealistic at a glance.
                </p>

                    Aside from the graphics, the raw power available in computer hardware today is massive. Graphics cards are harnessing the technology of real-time ray tracing, which is otherwise impossible to do on older graphics cards. New processors are more powerful and more efficient than ever before. Even consoles are able to take advantage of this power, thanks to the power of competitive markets and deals. In comparison to video games from 2010, games in 2020 are like future Hill Valley from Back to the Future 2. This is the future, and video games are at their peak. This was also the case with previous generations of hardware, of course, but this generational leap seems more grand than previous generational leaps. My expectations are surpassed every time a new generation of consoles and PC hardware releases, however, so all I can say is that this generation is the best. Until the next generation comes.
